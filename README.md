# Rule Based Classification
A gaming company wants to create new customer profiles (personas) based on certain features of their customers, and then segment these profiles to predict how much revenue a new customer might generate for the company, based on these segments.

For example: The company wants to estimate how much a 25-year-old male iOS user from Turkey might contribute on average.

The "Persona.csv" dataset contains information about the prices of products sold by an international gaming company, as well as some demographic details of users who purchased these products. The dataset consists of records from each transaction, meaning it is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with specific demographic traits may have made multiple purchases.

Price: The amount spent by the customer
Source: The type of device the customer is using
Sex: The customer's gender
Country: The customer's country
Age: The customer's age
